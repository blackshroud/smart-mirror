{"name":"Smart-mirror","tagline":"Interactive Smart Mirror","body":"# Smart Mirror\r\nThis project is inspired by [HomeMirror](https://github.com/HannahMitt/HomeMirror) and Michael Teeuw's [Magic Mirror](http://michaelteeuw.nl/tagged/magicmirror) and evancohens [SmartMirror](https://github.com/evancohen/smart-mirror) . It uses [annyang](https://github.com/TalAter/annyang) for voice interactivity, [electron](http://electron.atom.io/) to make it cross platform, and integrates with Philips Hue and can also display RSS feeds and iCal for your convenience.\r\n\r\n### Getting Started\r\n#### Hardware Components\r\n- Raspberry Pi 2 (optional)\r\n- USB Microphone (Or Webcam w/ microphone)\r\n- Monitor (with the bezel removed - optional)\r\n- Mirror Pane (aka Observation Glass) (optional)\r\n- Philips Hue (optional)\r\n\r\n#### Installation\r\n\r\nI have set this up so that it can run of of any web server, so as long as you have a webserver running somewhere, that you can host this from, you should be fine. (keeping in mind that you MUST use Chrome to display it)\r\n\r\n##### Setting up the configuration\r\nDone? Excellent, let's continue.\r\n\r\nTime to update the config file... You'll need to fill in things in `js/config.js`:\r\n\r\n1. A [Forecast API key](https://developer.forecast.io/) (don't worry, it's free)\r\n2. Philips Hue Bridge IP address with a configured user. Details about how to set this up in the [Philips Hue Developer Documentation](http://www.developers.meethue.com/documentation/getting-started)\r\n4. Set RSS feed location in config.js\r\n5. Add iCal URL to config.js\r\n\r\nTo set the default MAP home, update the address located in map-service.js\r\n\r\n### License:\r\nMIT\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
